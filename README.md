# Project-Management-Form
I have created a form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where I utilize a JsonPowerDB to store data programmatically. Through this project, I aim to learn API testing in conjunction with JsonPowerDB. The integration of these technologies allows me to explore and understand the intricacies of interacting with a JSON-based database, providing valuable insights into the world of API testing. This practical application enhances my understanding of web development by enabling me to dynamically handle data through the form and interact with a backend database using JavaScript. Through this hands-on experience, I am gaining practical knowledge in working with APIs and databases, contributing to my overall skill set in web development and testing.
